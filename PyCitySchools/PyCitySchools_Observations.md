## Observable Trends

Based on the data provided, we can observe the following:
1. The five schools with the highest % overall passing rate were all charter schools.
2. The five schools with the lowest % overall passing rate were all large district schools in the highest range of budget per student.
3. When binned by spending per student, the highest mean % overall passing rate (90.37%) is found at the schools with the lowest spending per student (<$584). The mean % overall passing rate decreases as we move up into increased spending per student ranges, and the mean % overall passing rate is at its lowest (53.53%) at the highest range of spending per student ($644-$675).
